                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emily is a fierce advocate for the students in Waco. As 
                                a parent and community volunteer, she is working to help 
                                support our educators. COVID-19 caused our kids to 
                                experience an unfortunate learning loss; an emphasis on 
                                curriculum and instruction in the district will help us 
                                achieve the student outcomes we are all working toward, 
                                together.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                The current school board trustees appointed Emily to fill 
                                the remainder of the District 5 term in September 2021. That 
                                process included an application letter and interview in 
                                front of the board. Since being appointed, Emily has jumped 
                                into the work of the board. She attended the Texas Association 
                                of School Boards txEDCON in Dallas for an initial round of 
                                training and has also completed training from the Education 
                                Service Center Region 12, the Texas Attorney General, and 
                                Waco ISD’s superintendent.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Emily worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the district’s 
                                November 2021 bond election. At the beginning of 2021, before 
                                she was appointed to the board, she served on the 5-month 
                                long-range facilities planning committee assessing the district 
                                needs and recommending the bond election to replace four WISD schools. 
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">                         
                                Once on the board, Emily provided informational video presentations to 
                                community groups and neighborhood associations looking for a virtual 
                                way to learn more about the bond election. She made dozens of phone 
                                calls and knocked on doors across district 5 to answer voter questions 
                                about the election. On November 2, voters overwhelmingly approved the 
                                district’s plan to improve equity across school facilities.
