                            Emily is a fierce advocate for the students in Waco. As a parent and community volunteer, she is working to help support our educators. COVID-19 caused our kids to experience an unfortunate learning loss; an emphasis on curriculum and instruction in the district will help us achieve the student outcomes we are all working toward, together. 
                            The current school board trustees appointed Emily to fill the remainder of the District 5 term in September 2021. That process included an application letter and interview in front of the board. Since being appointed, Emily has jumped into the work of the board. She attended the Texas Association of School Boards txEDCON in Dallas for an initial round of training and has also completed training from the Education Service Center Region 12, the Texas Attorney General, and Waco ISD’s superintendent.        
                            Emily worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the district’s November 2021 bond election. At the beginning of 2021, before she was appointed to the board, she served on the 5-month long-range facilities planning committee assessing the district needs and recommending the bond election to replace four WISD schools.                          
                            Once on the board, Emily provided informational video presentations to community groups and neighborhood associations looking for a virtual way to learn more about the bond election. She made dozens of phone calls and knocked on doors across district 5 to answer voter questions about the election. On November 2, voters overwhelmingly approved the district’s plan to improve equity across school facilities.

                            Emily is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Journalism, Public Relations and New Media at Baylor University. She also works as a public relations consultant to nonprofit and small businesses. Previously, she was a news anchor at KWTX-TV for seven years. Her communications skills and connection to the community are a benefit to the board.
                            She and her husband, Matt, have two children at Lake Air Montessori. Emily has volunteered as the Lake Air Parent Teacher Association president, vice president, treasurer and festival chair since joining the #LAMMfam in 2017. She worked to start a school-wide Read-a-Thon that raised more than $10,000 for grants for Lake Air teachers.  
                            Emily volunteers on the Lake Air Campus Decision Making Committee and the Waco ISD GT Advisory Committee. She has been involved for multiple years with the Waco ISD Women’s Empowerment Summit and the Waco ISD Education Foundation Cookoff Committee. She began serving on the Waco ISD Education Foundation in 2021.
